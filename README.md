# My-Smart--Contracts

Keeping all my smart contracts from remix

Maybe some of them :xD

### Formatting

- To format all the solidity files in the project do -
  ```bash
  npm i
  npm run prettier
  ```
- Using [`prettier-plugin-solidity`](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity) as formatter as it officially used by [harhat official vscode extension](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode#features) thus the `.prettierrc.js` config file changes will be respected by vscode as well.
- FYI: Any solidity file saved in this project will be formatted on save automatically. Also, make sure you have installed official [_Solidity + Hardhat_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) VS Code extension by [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
